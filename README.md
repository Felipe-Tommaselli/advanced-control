# Advanced Control

Curated repository of materials from four advanced control disciplines:

- SEL0367 — Adaptive Control
- SEL0326 — Linear Systems Control
- SEL0359 — Digital Control
- SEM5928 — Control Systems


## Repository layout

- `adaptative-control/`: MRAC, system identification, and exam/assignment notebooks
- `linear-control/`: state-space analysis, controllability/observability, LQR
- `digital-control/`: sampling, discrete-time design, labs and per-class notebooks
- `mimo-control-systems/`: SISO, MIMO, LQR, MPC, kalman-filters

## Run notebooks

Recommended: Python 3.10+ with Jupyter and control libraries.

```bash
pip install jupyter numpy scipy matplotlib control slycot
jupyter lab
```

## Highlights

- Adaptive: MRAC, parameter estimation, exam solutions
- Linear: LTI state-space design, observers, optimal control
- Digital: discrete design workflows, lab artifacts
- Control Systems (PhD): controller synthesis for MIMO projects
