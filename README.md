# Advanced Control

Compiled from Advanced Control code, including: 
- SEL0367-Adaptive Control (Undergrad)
- SEL0326- Linear Systems Control (Undergrad)
- SEL0359- Digital Control (Undergrad)
- SEM5928- Control Systems (PhD)

All programs developed in the discipline were written in Python and are for educational purposes only.

## Goals

Introduce the theoretical foundations and applications of adaptive control. Treat the various design approaches highlighting the different configurations of adaptive control and system identification.
Present the basic techniques for analyzing control systems in state space form to prepare the student to develop control application projects.
Introduce real-time control design techniques of dynamic systems and the use of the digital computer as part of the system to be studied, and implement control algorithms.
