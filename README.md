# Advanced Control

Curated repository of materials from four advanced control disciplines:

- SEL0367 — Adaptive Control
- SEL0326 — Linear Systems Control
- SEL0359 — Digital Control
- SEM5928 — Control Systems

Focus: concise, professional references and working notebooks. Code and notes are for academic use.

## Repository layout

- AdaptiveControl/ — MRAC, system identification, and exam/assignment notebooks
- LinearSystemsControl/ — state-space analysis, controllability/observability, LQR, projects
- DigitalControl/ — sampling, discrete-time design, labs and per-class notebooks
- ControlSystems/ — PhD-level topics; controllers and Kalman filtering
- Assets/ — shared images and figures

## Run notebooks

Recommended: Python 3.10+ with Jupyter and control libraries.

```bash
pip install jupyter numpy scipy matplotlib control slycot
jupyter lab
```

## Highlights

- Adaptive: MRAC, parameter estimation, exam solutions
- Linear: LTI state-space design, observers, optimal control
- Digital: discrete design workflows, lab artifacts
- Control Systems (PhD): controller synthesis and KF basics
